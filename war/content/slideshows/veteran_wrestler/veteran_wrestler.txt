Dr. Henrik Mensch is a gynecologist and also a passionate wrestler. He was the oldest competitor in the Veteran Wrestling Championship 2012 held in Budapest, Hungary. As his last challenge, he entered the championship to try his luck in the eldest age group (66-70 yrs) of veteran wrestling. The father of Henrik was also a wrestler, who started this sport in 1932. His two sons followed his steps, and both of them became wrestlers. Henrik grew up next to the mat, and he has never given up the trainings, not even during his career as a doctor. He was training for this competition four-five times a week. His younger son helped him as his trainer.
